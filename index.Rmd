#### I have a passion for problem solving! Whether it is computer programming or writing proofs, I love the challenge of discovering solutions. I have applied my skills to research projects like counting juggling patterns and blood spatter analysis. Also I accepted an analytics position at John Deere's Intelligent Solutions Group (ISG). I am excited to begin my career as a Data Scientist!  ####
